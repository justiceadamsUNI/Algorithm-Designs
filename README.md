# Algorithm-Designs
Extra credit projects completed for CS 3530: Design and Analysis of Algorithms

 I also plan on going beyond the call of duty and including visual representations 
 when possible as well as unit test in Python. I started doing this solely to 
 refresh my Python knowledge, because at my current job we rely on python 
 scripts frequently in our development process
 
 Also I've decided to include unit test, and example gifs when possible!
 
 Notes: The extra credit assignments involved implementing the BRUTE FORCE 
 implementations of these algorithms. I fully understand that there are better implementations.
 For example, a dynamic programming approach to the knapsack problem is much better
 than the brute force solution you will find here. That being said, that wasn't the assignment :).
 I decided to spend extra time exploring unit test in python rather than uploading better solutions.
 
 Also, as of 1/16/17, I am officially done with this repo. The class has ended. Hopefully, this can 
 help someone out there, and I'm more than happy to respond to any comments or suggestions.
