The optimal knapsack algorithm was implemented in Python. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) defines the knapsack problem as 'Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.' The following algorithm was implemented for extra credit for CS 3530 Design and Analysis of Algorithms. **I will be adding Unit test very soon**, simply for the sake of increasing my python knowledge. In order to see a current implementation of unit testing with Python, see [The convex hull problem](../Convex Hull Problem/)

## MatPlotLib
In order to fully utilize the knapsack script, I recommend installing [MatPlotLib](http://matplotlib.org/) to see a pie chart of the computed optimal knapsack. You can install the MatPlotLib library quite easily with pip. 

`python -m pip install matplotlib`

## Example Script Run
Here's an gif of what it would look like to run the script with the following set of data:  
weights = [70, 73, 77, 80, 82, 87, 90, 94, 98, 106, 110, 113, 115, 118, 120]  
values = [135, 139, 149, 150, 156, 163, 173, 184, 192, 201, 210, 214, 221, 229, 240]  
capacity = 750  

Note that the gif is on a loop.
